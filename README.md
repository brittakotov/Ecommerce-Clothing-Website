# Project Catwalk
Github Workflow:
1. To pull down most current master version from central repo: git pull origin main
2. Make a new branch and name it accordingly based on feature being implemented: git checkout -b (insert branch name)
3. Commit as you complete each implementation ticket or as you like
4. Push your current working branch: git push origin (current branch name)
5. Go on github and prepare to submit a pull request.
6. Within pull request submission, fill out comment section to clarify commits, and include a link to the corresponding trello ticket id.

If you have an open PR:
1. Repeat above steps
2. Do not edit files that are in your open PR

Notes:
1. Never merge your own code!
2. Always merge on Github.
3. The reviewer must merge your code.

When reviewing someone else's PR:
1. Clone a copy of the repo
2. Name it something (ex. code review repo)
3. Checkout the branch you are reviewing
4. Test the code, look at the code, etc.
5. Click merge button on Github if you approve the code.
6. If you do not approve, make comment on Github PR. For reviewer: only merge after all comments are resolved and the code has been reviewed.
